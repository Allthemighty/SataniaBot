# Introduction

This is a discord bot developed in discord.py . It's mainly developed for a private server, so it's functionality may not appeal to everyone. That said, feel free to modify/use it for your purposes.

# Setup

The bot requires two things to function.

1. A bot token, gotten from a discord bot account.
2. A PostgreSQL database, with it's database URL. (SETUP SCRIPT WILL BE UP SOON)
